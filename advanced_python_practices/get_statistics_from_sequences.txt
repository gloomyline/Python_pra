No. 91 (Composite) Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing active during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath. It was formed on 20 October 1950 to administer No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron, No. 30 Communications Flight, No. 391 (Base) Squadron, and No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron. The wing and its units were headquartered at Iwakuni, Japan, except for No. 77 Squadron, which was based in Korea and tasked by the US Fifth Air Force. No. 30 Flight was re-designated No. 30 Communications Unit in November 1950, No. 30 Transport Unit a year later, and No. 36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953. Operating mainly C-47 Dakotas, it undertook medical evacuation, cargo and troop transport, and courier flights. No. 77 Squadron converted from P-51 Mustangs to Gloster Meteors (pictured) between April and July 1951, and operated primarily in the ground attack role. It remained in Korea on garrison duty following the July 1953 armistice, and returned to Australia in November 1954; No. 491 Squadron disbanded the same month. No. 36 Squadron returned to Australia in March 1955; the following month, No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing headquarters disbanded. (Full article...)
